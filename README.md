# Flutter Tutorials

* [Flutter tutorial for beginners](https://youtu.be/GLSG_Wh_YWc) - very basic stuff but it only covers the first 2 sessions of his [course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/?couponCode=FLT_YT). The full Udemy course covers many Flutter topics, but it could be outdated now.
* [Flutter tutorials from the official website](https://flutter.io/docs/reference/tutorials)
* [Fluttery youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtWyVkPpb8An90SNDTNF0Pg) - Although the videos are very long, the level of details covered in the videos is fantastic
